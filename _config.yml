title: A scrupulous look at the world!!!
description : Hi! I am a Theoretical Physics student. I am trying to rationalise world around me starting from the Postulates of Quantum Mechanics. I will try writing regularly about whatever I read new in Physics. I like Mathematics (on which I also plan to write) very much, hence in admire I tend to like analytical approaches more. However, I admire the power of numerics and computation, allowing one to setup a laboritory on their lap ;)
